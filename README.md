The goal of this project is to identify the variables that impact the development and severity of Alzheimer's disease. The goal of determining these factors and their correlation to Alzheimer's will in theory be used to predict and determine not only how to determine who is at risk for Alzheimer's but also help protect people from suffering from this disease.

These goals were achieve through proper data cleaning using the following techniques

- np.where
- pd.getdummies
- mean replacement of nulls
- standardization

Visualization was done through seaborn and matplotlib
- scatter
- boxplots
- heatmaps

Prediction Models Ran

- Multi-Linear Regression Models

Optomization Models Run

- Over-Sampling
- ROC/AUC curve

In conclusion, I determined the variables with the strongest relation for result and demenatated severity to be brain volume and mini-mental state exam. Because brain volume is the only really variable you can change at all it shows that it is important to exercise your brain just like any other muscle or it will shrink. This is most critial in early development because this is when your brain is still growing. These models also show how much harder it is to predict dementia than it is predict the severity of dimensia. Alzheimers is a scary disease and sometimes there is little we can do to combat it, but it is important to be imformed on how to protect yourself.
